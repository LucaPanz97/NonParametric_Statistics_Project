# NonParametric_Statistics_Project 

# Goal

The goal of this project is developing a model to predict and explain the price of houses in King County, Washington, following a nonparametric approach.

The work is carried out in this way:
1. Preprocessing and outlier detection through bagplots based on Tukey depth
2. Testing the significance of some covariates on price by permutational T and permutational ANOVA 
3. Fitting nonparametric regression models such as GAMs with splines and robust regression models
