# NonParametric_Statistics_Project 

# Goal

The goal of this project is making inference on products calories of a real McDonald's menu.  
Specifically, we formulated three different models:
1. Linear regression model to explain calories as a function of other covariates
2. Anova model to assess whether products categories affect caloric intake 
3. Logit regression model to find the probability that products with a certain amount of calories belong to the class of products with the highest caloric intake
